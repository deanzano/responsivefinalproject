      <p>As a bald Civil Engineering professor with a passion for boxing, I have often found myself at the intersection of grit and precision—whether in the ring or the classroom. My unique combination of academic rigor and athletic discipline sparked the imagination of one of my students, who proposed a creative tribute through digital art. The concept was to capture my persona not just as an educator, but as someone who embodies strength, resilience, and a touch of unconventional flair. It was a thoughtful gesture that reflected both admiration and artistic ingenuity.</p>
      <p>The resulting images were crafted by one of my most outstanding Civil Engineering students, R. Vejano, who graduated Magna Cum Laude and is well on the path to becoming a licensed engineer. His work not only showcases technical skill but also a deep understanding of character and symbolism. I’m proud to share these pieces as a testament to the vibrant minds I have had the privilege to mentor—where engineering meets creativity, and where future professionals like Engr. Vejano continue to push boundaries beyond the blueprint.</p>
